My solution for a iOS developer position assignment 

#Original assignment

Write a mobile application that can price a basket of goods in a number of different currencies. The goods that can be purchased, which are all priced in GBP, are: 

* Milk – 95p per carton
* Cola – 50p per can
* Beer – £4.99 per pack
* Wine – £10.90 per bottle

The program should allow the user to add or remove items in a basket. The user can click on a checkout button which will then display the total price for the basket with the option to display the amount in different currencies. The list of currencies should be consumed and the currency conversion should be performed using the jsonrates API.
